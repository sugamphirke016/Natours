## Lessons Learned

1. How CSS works behind the scenes: the cascade, render tree, specificity, inheritance, value processing, the visual formatting model, the box model, box types, positioning schemes, stacking contexts, and CSSOM.

2. Advanced responsive design workflows: mobile-first vs desktop-first strategies, selecting breakpoints, em vs rem units and feature queries to test for browser support.

3. Videos in HTML and CSS: building a background video effect.

4. Responsive images in HTML and CSS for faster pageloads: resolution switching, density switching & art direction.

5. 7-1 Sass Architecture, component-based design and BEM model.
